# IonQ Forte #AQ29 Data
This repository contains circuits, measured and simulated results demonstrating #AQ29 on IonQ Forte.

## Circuits
The repository contains multiple instance of cirucuits generated for different application-oriented algorithms: 
- `AE` - Amplitude Estimation
- `HSIM` - Hamiltonian Simulation
- `MC` - Monte Carlo Sampling
- `PE` - Phase Estimation
- `QFT` - Quantum Fourier Transform
- `VQE` - VQE Simulation

All circuits are provided in [OpenQasm 2.0] as submitted to the system, as transpiled by qiskit, and as transpiled by the IonQ compiler to the level of native gates. The naming convention is `ALG`N`QQ`V`II`_`V` where
- `ALG` - algorithm identifier as listed above
- `QQ` - number of qubits used in the circuit
- `II` - instance identifier as a number
- `V` - variant identifier (specified for the circuits compiled to native gates)

For example, `circuits/input/AEN04V02.qasm` is the second instance of the amplitude estimation algorithm on four qubits as submitted to the system, while `circuits/ionq/AEN04V02_2` is its second variant transpilation to native gates.
## Results
The measured results are provided in `results/measured.json` while the results generated by a noisy simulator are given in `results/simulated.json`. All results are indexed by circuit and variant identifiers.
## Data
Characterization and benchmarking data used for the figures is provided in `data`.
